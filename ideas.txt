Yokai Assassination

Intro:
Guard A: Have you heard? Yokai have been appearing around the palace recently.
Guard B: Really? I had no idea...
Guard A: Apparently, the shogun and the council are in disarray. It would be prime time
for the Katsu clan to strike.
Guard B: **Stops**
Guard A: What's the matter? Getting tired?
Guard B: No... it's just...
		My brother went missing several days ago...
		I've had to guard the front gate
		on my own since then...
Guard A: You mean Tezuka-kun?
Guard B:
		Now I'm thinking about those yokai and...
		Wait...
		Did you address him with kun?
Guard A: Oh! How disrespectful! I meant Tezuka-senpai!
Guard B: ...
		My brother holds the highest role in the palace
		save for the councilmen themselves...
		He is the master of the front gate...
		Everyone addresses him with sama!
		**Approaches**
		What was your name again?
		And where did you come from?
		I thought I was alone?
Guard A: **stabs**
Tezuka (yokai): **Walks in**
**play ominous music**
Guard A: Ah! "Tezuka-kun"! There you are!
		You wouldn't believe the information
		I've just received from this human!
		Yee hee hee!
Tezuka:	Pray tell, you sly spirit!
		Yo ho ho!
Guard A: It seems we are expected to guard
		the front gate!
Tezuka: Like taking candy from a baby!


Council meeting
Shogun exposed as yokai, MC gets thrown out of the gate,
meets a wounded Kitsune. The two merge into one

MC (monologue): Surely, life has drawn its blade
				upon my mind several times over.
				But that man was not the Shogun
				I chose to devote my life to.
				Whatever it takes, even at the
				cost of my life, I must
				convince my people of the truth!
				**runs**
Kitsune: Wait!
MC: Who are you? Yokai?
Kitsune: Brave samurai, to lie
		would bring me dishoner.
		I am a Yokai...
		I am the guardian of these fields.
		Your tales refer to me as the angel
		of the harvest.

MC: Kitsune! So the depictions are true!
	We've lost faith in you since
	the Yokai attacks!

Kitsune:
		Long have I protected your clan
		from Yokai invasions...
		But the one posing as your
		Shogun wounded me in battle,
		leaving me to die a shameful death.
MC: Please, let me offer
	something! Anything
	to bring back your vitality!
Kitsune:
		If you offer me your body,
		I can give you the wisdom and strength
		to save your people.

MC: What will become of us?
Kitsune: You and I will remain bound
		until time seizes our vessel.
		Upon our death, my spirit
		will return to the fields,
		and like a phoenix rising from
		the ashes, my role will continue.
MC: I see...
		To be immortal
		would remove what makes
		the human race special.
Kitsune: ...
		You and I will forsake ourselves
		and become one.
		Do you understand these consequences?
MC: I do...
	For the sake of my shogun,
	I mustn't be selfish.
	I accept your offer!
